## Warmup Goals
All warm ups are present and complete to the best of my ability. My code sucks and that's okay. My goal is to continue with these exercises weekly.

### Daily Warmup

Work with arrays, functions, looping, and objects. Implement spread, deconstruction techniques along with map, filter and reduce.

### The Holy Grail

Implement the "Holy Grail" web layout using Float, Flexbox, and Grid.

### Express Server

A JS developer should be able to produce an express server "on demand"â€”this warm-up involves creating a basic express server, utilizing the core express components (get, post, static-rendering, middleware).

### Data Structures

This data structure practice helps me get ready for whiteboarding while also increasing my knowldege of how data structers work and tie into code.

This warmup was based on traversal and I feel confident in the majority of my work.

### Async

Using Async and Promises is a huge win for JavaScript allowing fo the speedy return of requests.

## Summary

I attempted all these warmups on my own and only sought outside help in the form of understanding the solution code and adapting them to my style of coding.
